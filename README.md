# Haploblock_Gene_Divergence
Scripts and files produced to analyze SNP divergence between haplotype-specific gene variants of Helianthus haploblocks


###Files

All_Gene_Variants_Dn.Ds.txt: All haplotype-specific gene variants, listed with sense and nonsense mutation counts, Ka/Ks for SNPs with AF>0.9, TAIR homolog descriptions, and Ka/Ks p-values.

All_Gene_Variants_Grantham_Distances.txt: Grantham distances between haplotype-specific predicted protein products for all haploblocks, listed with missense and stop codon counts, and TAIR homolog descriptions.

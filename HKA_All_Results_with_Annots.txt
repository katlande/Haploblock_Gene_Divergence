Represses expression of Constans (CO), a circadian regulator of flowering time.  Interacts with LKP2 and FKF1. Expression oscillates under constant light conditions. Mainly expressed in the vasculature of cotyledons, leaves and hypocotyls, but also in stomata. Localized to the nucleus and acts as a repressor of CONSTANS through binding to the Dof binding sites in the CO promoter. Protein gets degraded by FKF1 in the afternoon. CDF1 binds to the TOPLESS co-repressor protein through an N-terminal motif which is conserved across CDF-like proteins throughout land-plants. This interaction is important for the repression of CO and FT genes during the morning. Loss of CDF1 dependent repression through omission of TPL coordinating residues or through the loss of TPL function in phloem companion cells results in early flowering due to an up regulation of FT.

Represses expression of Constans (CO), a circadian regulator of flowering time.  Interacts with LKP2 and FKF1. Expression oscillates under constant light conditions. Mainly expressed in the vasculature of cotyledons, leaves and hypocotyls, but also in stomata. Localized to the nucleus and acts as a repressor of CONSTANS through binding to the Dof binding sites in the CO promoter. Protein gets degraded by FKF1 in the afternoon. CDF1 binds to the TOPLESS co-repressor protein through an N-terminal motif which is conserved across CDF-like proteins throughout land-plants. This interaction is important for the repression of CO and FT genes during the morning. Loss of CDF1 dependent repression through omission of TPL coordinating residues or through the loss of TPL function in phloem companion cells results in early flowering due to an up regulation of FT.

TPD1 is involved in cell specification during anther and pollen development. Identified in a screen for male steriles. Mutants lack tapetal cells and have an increased number of microsporocytes. Expressed in flower buds, leaves and young seedlings. In anthers, TPD1 is expressed throughout pollen development in parietal cells and sporocytes. Physically interacts with the LRR kinase EMS1 and that interaction results in phosphorylation of TPD1.

Acts opposite to CLF which represses AG, but preventing deposition of CLF repressive methylation marks.ULT1 acts as an anti-repressor that counteracts EMF1 action through modulation of histone marks on target genes. Regulates developmental as well as biotic and abiotic stress response genes.

It recognizes proteins with the PTS1 consensus sequence (tripeptide SKL or a conserved variant) at the extreme C terminus.  The protein has several domains, including C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat motifs which act in binding the C-terminal SKL targeting signal.  The mechanism of transport has been worked out in other organisms:  The receptor recognizes and binds cytosolic PTS1-containing proteins.  The PEX5-PTS1 complex binds a PEX14/PEX13 receptor complex at the peroxisome membrane and is translocated into the peroxisome matrix in a process dependent on PEX2,PEX10, and PEX12.  In the peroxisome matrix, PEX5 releases its cargo and is recycled to the cytosol in a process dependent on PEX1, PEX4, PEX6 and PEX22.  It is also involved, in conjunction with PEX7, in PTS1- and PTS2-dependent peroxisomal protein import.  RNAi experiments suggest that PEX5 is necessary for the maintenance of both glyoxysomal and leaf peroxisomal functions.

Arabidopsis ATRX mutant alleles are viable, but with reduced fertility. Their combination with mutants for the H3.3 chaperone HIRA impairs plant survival. ATRX loss affects cellular histone H3.3 pools and modulates the H3.1/H3.3 balance.

Arabidopsis ATRX mutant alleles are viable, but with reduced fertility. Their combination with mutants for the H3.3 chaperone HIRA impairs plant survival. ATRX loss affects cellular histone H3.3 pools and modulates the H3.1/H3.3 balance.

Loss of function severely affects organ initiation, pin1 mutants are characterised by an inflorescence meristem that does not initiate any flowers, resulting in the formation of a naked inflorescence stem.  PIN1 is involved in the determination of leaf shape by actively promoting development of leaf margin serrations.  In roots, the protein mainly resides at the basal end of the vascular cells, but weak signals can be detected in the epidermis and the cortex.  Expression levels and polarity of this auxin efflux carrier change during primordium development suggesting that cycles of auxin build-up and depletion accompany, and may direct, different stages of primordium development.

The gene is expressed during early seedling growth, in roots and lateral root primordia, in flower and fruit abscission zone, in vascular system of cotyledons, young leaves and petals, in mature rosette leaves, in anthers, as shown by GUS activity patterns. The expression of several phylogenetically closely-related AtMLO genes showed similar or overlapping tissue specificity and analogous responsiveness to external stimuli, suggesting functional redundancy, co-function, or antagonistic function(s).

A significant fraction of the protein is found in the ER.  Mutants carrying null alleles express similar fruit phenotypes, as seen in er plants, but differ from er in that the stem is only slightly shorter than that in the wild type, the pedicel is slightly longer than that in the wild type, and the leaves are rounder than those in er mutants. Gene is expressed in all tissues examined, with highest expression level found in siliques. It is involved in resistance to Plectosphaerella cucumerina. The predicted protein has two DWD motifs. It can bind to DDB1a in Y2H assays and may be involved in the formation of a CUL4-based E3 ubiquitin ligase.  It seems to be involved in the calcium-mediated response to extracellular ATP.

Mutants carrying null alleles express similar fruit phenotypes, as seen in er plants, but differ from er in that the stem is only slightly shorter than that in the wild type, the pedicel is slightly longer than that in the wild type, and the leaves are rounder than those in er mutants. Gene is expressed in all tissues examined, with highest expression level found in siliques. It is involved in resistance to Plectosphaerella cucumerina. The predicted protein has two DWD motifs. It can bind to DDB1a in Y2H assays and may be involved in the formation of a CUL4-based E3 ubiquitin ligase.  It seems to be involved in the calcium-mediated response to extracellular ATP.

JAZ1 transcript levels rise in response to a jasmonate stimulus. JAZ1 can interact with the COI1 F-box subunit of an SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase in a yeast-two-hybrid assay only in the presence of jasmonate-isoleucine (JA-ILE) or coronatine. Application of jasmonate methyl ester to Arabidopsis roots reduces the levels of a JAZ1:GUS fusion protein, presumably  by stimulating ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation. The Jas domain appears to be important for JAZ1-COI1 interactions in the presence of coronatine. Two positive residues (R205 and R206) in the Jas domain shown to be important for coronatine -dependent COI1 binding are not required for binding AtMYC2. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

About 10-20% of mutants also have defects in ovules. Mutants have reduced fertility most likely as because of fusions that pistil emergence. The protein has similarity to the mandelonitrile lyase family of FAD containing oxidoreductases and is predicted to be secreted (SignalP).It is expressed in all tissue layers of roots, inflorescences, stems, leaves, and flowers and is also expressed in siliques. Expression is highest in inflorescence and flower tissue.Transmission of mutant alleles to the progeny shows non mendelian segregation- a percentage of mutant alleles revert back to a previous parental (e.g. grandparental) wild type allele. It has been suggested that an RNA template driven or other extra-DNA genomic mechanism may be responsible for the non-mendelian inheritance of HTH. Reversion events in alleles at other loci have also been observed to occur in plants with an hth mutant background indicating a genome wide effect.

Also involved in cytokinin-dependent inhibition of hypocotyl elongation and cytokinin-dependent greening and shooting in tissue culture. ARR1, ARR10, and ARR12 are redundant regulators of drought response, with ARR1 being the most critical.The retention of leaf water content, maintenance of cell membrane stability, and enhancement of anthocyanin biosynthesis were found to contribute to the enhanced drought tolerance of the arr1,10,12 triple mutant. ARR1, ARR10 and ARR12 redundantly bind to the promoter of WUSCHEL (WUS), directly activate its transcription. In parallel, ARR1, ARR10 and ARR12 repress the expression of YUCCAs (YUCs), which encode a key enzyme for auxin biosynthesis, indirectly promoting WUS induction. The regulation of ARR1, ARR10 and ARR12 on WUS and YUCs is required for regeneration and maintenance of shoot meristem.

Null mutants exhibit normal vegetative and flower development; however, during prophase I, chromosomes become fragmented resulting in random distribution of the fragments between polyads. Both male and female meiosis are defective and strong accumulation of AtRAD51 was observed in the inflorescence nuclei of mutant plants. Similarly to its yeast and animal homologues, AtMnd1 might play a role in DSB repair during meiosis.

DAYSLEEPER was isolated as a factor binding to a motif (Kubox1) present in the upstream region of the Arabidopsis DNA repair gene Ku70. Mutant plants lacking DAYSLEEPER or strongly overexpressing this gene do not develop in a normal manner.

Functions by demethylating the target promoter DNA. Interacts physically with RPA2/ROR1. In the ros1 mutants, an increase in methylation is observed in a number of gene promoters. Among the loci affected by ros1, a few (RD29A and At1g76930) are affected in cytosine methylation in all sequence contexts (CpG, CpNpG or CpNpN), although many others are affected primarily in non-CpG contexts. The ros1 mutant is more susceptible to biotrophic pathogens and is repressed in its responsiveness of salyclic acid-dependent defence genes.

Mutants are early flowering and exhibit hypersensitive response to ABA in germination inhibition.Loss of ABH1 function results in abnormal processing of mRNAs for several important floral regulators (FLC, CO, FLM). Analysis of loss of function mutations suggests a role in pri-miRNA processing and mRNA splicing. Note that two different mutant alleles were given the same name abh1-7 (Kuhn et al 2007; Kim et al 2008).  To avoid confusion, abh1-7 described in Kim et al (2008) has been renamed abh1-107 (other names: ensalada-1, ens-1).

Mutants exhibit parthenogenetic development that includes proliferation of unfertilized endosperm and embryos. In heterozygous plants 50% of embryos abort. Of the aborted embryos the early aborted class are homozygous and the later aborting lass are heterozygotes in which the defective allele is maternally transmitted. Other phenotypes include defects in ovule morphogenesis and organ initiation,as well as increased levels of heterochromatic DNA. MSI1 is needed for the transition to flowering. In Arabidopsis, the three CAF-1 subunits are encoded by FAS1, FAS2 and, most likely, MSI1, respectively. Mutations in FAS1 or FAS2 lead to increased frequency of homologous recombination and T-DNA integration in Arabidopsis. In the ovule, the MSI1 transcripts are accumulated at their highest level before fertilization and gradually decrease after fertilization. MSI is biallelically expressed, the paternall allele is expressed in the endosperm and embryo and is not imprinted. MSI1 forms a complex with RBR1 that is required for activation of the imprinted genes FIS2 and FWA. This activation is mediated by MSI1/RBR1 mediated repression of MET1.

EGY1 is required for development of both thylakoid grana and a well-organized lamellae system in chloroplast. Additionally, EGY1 is required for the accumulation of chlorophyll and chlorophyll a/b binding (CAB) proteins (both PS I and PS II) in chloroplast membranes, and for grana formation and normal chloroplast development. Loss of EGY1 function also has an effect on endodermal plastid biogenesis. Mutant studies suggest that EGY1 is involved in the regulation of nuclear gene expression response to ammonium stress and interacts with ABA signaling.

JKD and its homologue BIB, restrict SHR movement to a single layer, the endodermis, and delimit tissue boundaries in the root meristem through a process that involves nuclear retention through protein complex formation. JKD mutation leads to periclinal divisions in the cortex, increased cell numbers in the circumference of the cortical and epidermal layers, a disrupted QC marker expression pattern, and disorganized QC and columella cells. This effect is enhanced in jkd bib double mutants where tissue boundaries cannot be maintained due to excessive SHR movement. JKD and BIB restrict CYCIND6 expression to cortex and endodermis stem cells to prevent formative divisions in the ground tissue.  JKD physically interacts with cell fate determinants SCR and SHR in a cell type specific manner. Native FRET-FLIM analysis showed higher JKD-SCR complex in the endodermis and predominant JKD-SHR in the QC and cortex/endodermis stem cells. In addition, JKD, SCR and SHR form a ternary complex whose conformation is cell type dependent, conformational changes of this complex differentially regulate SCR and WOX5 expression to specify endodermal cell fate and QC function respectively. Its mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

BRI1 ligand is brassinolide which binds at the extracellular domain. Binding results in phosphorylation of the kinase domain which activates the BRI1 protein leading to BR responses. Residue T-1049 and either S-1044 or T-1045 were essential for kinase function in vitro and normal BRI1 signaling in planta. The structure of BRI1 ligand-binding domain has been determined at 2.5A resolution.  Although BAK1 and BRI1 alone localize in the plasma membrane, when BAK1 and BRI1 are coexpressed, the heterodimer BAK1/BRI1 they form is localized in the endosome. BRI1 appears to be involved in the autonomous pathway that regulates the transition to flowering, primarily through its effects on FLC expression levels, as uncovered by double mutant analyses. This most likely occurs as a result of BRI1-dependent effects on histone acetylation, but not histone triMeH3K4 methylation, at the FLC locus. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

Protein has two plant-specific (AP2/EREB) DNA-binding domains and is involved in the control of storage compound biosynthesis in Arabidopsis. Mutants have wrinkled seed phenotype, due to a defect in the incorporation of sucrose and glucose into triacylglycerols. Transgenic sGsL plants (21-day-old) grown on 6% sucrose for 24 hours had 2-fold increase in levels of expressions (sGsL line carries a single copy of T-DNA containing the Spomin::GUS-Spomin::LUC dual reporter genes in the upper arm of chromosome 5 of ecotype Col-0.

Protein has two plant-specific (AP2/EREB) DNA-binding domains and is involved in the control of storage compound biosynthesis in Arabidopsis. Mutants have wrinkled seed phenotype, due to a defect in the incorporation of sucrose and glucose into triacylglycerols. Transgenic sGsL plants (21-day-old) grown on 6% sucrose for 24 hours had 2-fold increase in levels of expressions (sGsL line carries a single copy of T-DNA containing the Spomin::GUS-Spomin::LUC dual reporter genes in the upper arm of chromosome 5 of ecotype Col-0.

Very similar to BAM2,with more than 85% a.a. identity. It has a broad expression pattern and is involved in vascular strand development in the leaf, control of leaf shape, size and symmetry, male gametophyte development and ovule specification and function. Anthers of double mutants (bam1bam2) appeared abnormal at a very early stage and lack the endothecium, middle, and tapetum layers. Further analyses revealed that cells interior to the epidermis (in anther tissue) acquire some characteristics of pollen mother cells (PMCs), suggesting defects in cell fate specification. The pollen mother-like cells degenerate before the completion of meiosis, suggesting that these cells are defective. In addition, the BAM1 expression pattern supports both an early role in promoting somatic cell fates and a subsequent function in the PMCs. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

The cytoplasmic Ran GTPase activating protein RanGAP is critical to establish a functional RanGTP/RanGDP gradient across the nuclear envelope and is associated with the outer surface of the nuclear envelope in metazoan and higher plant cells. Arabidopsis thaliana RanGAP association with the root tip nuclear envelope requires a family of likely plant-specific nucleoporins combining coiled-coil and transmembrane domains (CC-TMD) and WPP domain-interacting proteins (WIPs).

Also known as AtMDR1.Possibly regulates auxin-dependent responses by influencing basipetal auxin transport in the root.  Exerts nonredundant, partially overlapping functions with the ABC transporter encoded by AT3G28860.  PGP1 mediates cellular efflux of IAA and interacts with PIN genes that may confer an accelerated vectoral component to PGP-mediated transport. The non-polar localization of PGP1 at root and shoot apices, where IAA gradient-driven transport is impaired, may be required to confer directionality to auxin transport in those tissues. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

This suggests that Pol IV primarily affects facultative heterochromatin rather than constitutive heterochromatin.

IRX14/MUCI64 is a GT43 protein essential for xylan elongation in seed coat mucilage. The xylan backbone maintains the attachment of mucilage to the seed surface and the distribution of cellulose. It was identified based on its gene expression co-variance with the IRX3 gene involved in secondary cell wall synthesis.  A biochemical assay using the irx14 mutant indicates that IRX14 might function in xylose chain elongation.

Regulates gibberellin biosynthesis. Activated by AGAMOUS in a cal-1, ap1-1 background. Expressed at low levels in developing stamens. Increased levels of ATH1 severely delay flowering in the  C24 accession. Most remarkably, ectopically expressed  ATH1 hardly had an effect on flowering time in the Col-0  and Ler accessions. ATH1 physically interacts with STM, BP and KNAT6 and enhances the shoot apical meristem defect of some of these genes suggesting a role in SAM maintenance. Nuclear localization is dependent upon interaction with STM.

Represses expression of Constans (CO), a circadian regulator of flowering time.  Interacts with LKP2 and FKF1. Expression oscillates under constant light conditions. Mainly expressed in the vasculature of cotyledons, leaves and hypocotyls, but also in stomata. Localized to the nucleus and acts as a repressor of CONSTANS through binding to the Dof binding sites in the CO promoter. Protein gets degraded by FKF1 in the afternoon. CDF1 binds to the TOPLESS co-repressor protein through an N-terminal motif which is conserved across CDF-like proteins throughout land-plants. This interaction is important for the repression of CO and FT genes during the morning. Loss of CDF1 dependent repression through omission of TPL coordinating residues or through the loss of TPL function in phloem companion cells results in early flowering due to an up regulation of FT.

Based on protein sequence alignment analysis, it has a typical RD signaling domain in its catalytic loop and possesses autophosphorylation activity.It is required for the suppression of defense responses in absence of pathogen infection or upon abscisic acid treatment. Loss-of-function mutants display enhanced resistance to Botrytis cinerea and Pectobacterium carotovorum. Its expression is repressed by pathogen infection and biological elicitors and is induced abscisic acid.Expression is strongly repressed by elicitors and fungal infection, and is induced by the hormone abscisic acid (ABA). Insertional mutants show increased expression of PHYTOALEXIN-DEFICIENT 3 (PAD3), enhanced resistance to Botrytis cinerea and Pectobacterium carotovorum infection and reduced physiological responses to ABA, suggesting that LYK3 is important for the cross-talk between signaling pathways activated by ABA and pathogens (PMID:24639336).

Expressed throughout the plant and localized to the plasma membrane. Loss of function mutations show an increased tolerance to salt based on assaying seedling growth in the presence of salt. In the mutants, induction of genes required for production of reactive oxygen species is reduced suggesting that itn1 promotes ROS production.  It interacts with RCN1 in vivo and may regulate its subcellular localization. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.	INCREASED TOLERANCE TO NACL (ITN1)	ANN_13_01
Ha412HOChr13g0599991	0	0	0	AT2G26330	Homologous to receptor protein kinases. Involved in specification of organs originating from the shoot apical meristem. Contains a cytoplasmic protein kinase catalytic domain, a transmembrane region, and an extracellular leucine-rich repeat.  ER has been identified as a quantitative trait locus for transpiration efficiency by influencing epidermal and mesophyll development, stomatal density and porosity of leaves. It has been implicated in resistance to the bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum and to the necrotrophic fungus Plectosphaerella cucumerina.  Together with ERL1 and ERL2, ER governs the initial decision of protodermal cells to either divide proliferatively to produce pavement cells or divide asymmetrically to generate stomatal complexes. ER binds to the peptides STOMAGEN and EPF2 which compete for the same binding site. The ER-EFP2 complex activates MAPK signaling that inhibits stomatal development. ER-STOMAGEN does not activate MAPK signaling. Plants harboring loss of function alleles of er are more susceptible to heat stress than wild type.  In Arabidopsis and other organisms, overexpression of ER confers thermotolerance via as yet undefined mechanisms.	ERECTA (ER)	ANN_13_01

Ha412HOChr13g0605321	0	0	0	AT5G03150	JKD is a nuclear-localized putative transcription factor of the BIRDS/IDD C2H2 zinc finger family. JKD and its homologue BIB, restrict SHR movement to a single layer, the endodermis, and delimit tissue boundaries in the root meristem through a process that involves nuclear retention through protein complex formation. JKD mutation leads to periclinal divisions in the cortex, increased cell numbers in the circumference of the cortical and epidermal layers, a disrupted QC marker expression pattern, and disorganized QC and columella cells. This effect is enhanced in jkd bib double mutants where tissue boundaries cannot be maintained due to excessive SHR movement. JKD and BIB restrict CYCIND6 expression to cortex and endodermis stem cells to prevent formative divisions in the ground tissue.  JKD physically interacts with cell fate determinants SCR and SHR in a cell type specific manner. Native FRET-FLIM analysis showed higher JKD-SCR complex in the endodermis and predominant JKD-SHR in the QC and cortex/endodermis stem cells. In addition, JKD, SCR and SHR form a ternary complex whose conformation is cell type dependent, conformational changes of this complex differentially regulate SCR and WOX5 expression to specify endodermal cell fate and QC function respectively. Its mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.	JACKDAW (JKD)	ANN_13_01

The DAYSLEEPER gene lacks 8 bp duplications and TIRs (a common feature of transcriptionally silent hAT transposases), however, DAYSLEEPER expression was detected, and several expressed sequence tags are available. The expression seems to be under the control of factors determining the circadian rhythm. DAYSLEEPER was isolated as a factor binding to a motif (Kubox1) present in the upstream region of the Arabidopsis DNA repair gene Ku70. Mutant plants lacking DAYSLEEPER or strongly overexpressing this gene do not develop in a normal manner.	DAYSLEEPER (DAYSLEEPER)	ANN_15_01

The NRPD2 protein is found at nuclear foci that overlap or are adjacent to chromocentromeres but are not fully coincident with chromocentromeres. The loss of NRPD2 leads to the loss of cytosine methylation at pericentromeric 5S genes and AtSN1 retroelements but has no discernible effect on centromere repeat methylation. This suggests that Pol IV primarily affects facultative heterochromatin rather than constitutive heterochromatin.	NUCLEAR RNA POLYMERASE D2A (NRPD2A)	ANN_15_01

IRX14/MUCI64 is a GT43 protein essential for xylan elongation in seed coat mucilage. The xylan backbone maintains the attachment of mucilage to the seed surface and the distribution of cellulose. It was identified based on its gene expression co-variance with the IRX3 gene involved in secondary cell wall synthesis.  A biochemical assay using the irx14 mutant indicates that IRX14 might function in xylose chain elongation.	IRREGULAR XYLEM 14 (IRX14)	ANN_15_01

Exerts nonredundant, partially overlapping functions with the ABC transporter encoded by AT3G28860.  PGP1 mediates cellular efflux of IAA and interacts with PIN genes that may confer an accelerated vectoral component to PGP-mediated transport. The non-polar localization of PGP1 at root and shoot apices, where IAA gradient-driven transport is impaired, may be required to confer directionality to auxin transport in those tissues.

Ha412HOChr06g0281901	159	0	3	AT1G08600	The Arabidopsis ATRX harbours a N-terminal ADD domain and a C-terminal helicase domain and is devoid of the large central region involved in DAXX interaction in mammals. Arabidopsis ATRX mutant alleles are viable, but with reduced fertility. Their combination with mutants for the H3.3 chaperone HIRA impairs plant survival. ATRX loss affects cellular histone H3.3 pools and modulates the H3.1/H3.3 balance. Notably, at a genome-wide scale, loss of ATRX leads to a reduced H3.3 level at genes characterized by elevated H3.3 occupancy and high expression, including the 45S ribosomal DNA (45S rDNA) loci. Indeed, expression of specific 45S rDNA sequence variants is altered by ATRX loss (DOI:10.1105/tpc.16.00877)	(ATRX)	ARG_06_01

Loss of function severely affects organ initiation, pin1 mutants are characterised by an inflorescence meristem that does not initiate any flowers, resulting in the formation of a naked inflorescence stem.  PIN1 is involved in the determination of leaf shape by actively promoting development of leaf margin serrations.  In roots, the protein mainly resides at the basal end of the vascular cells, but weak signals can be detected in the epidermis and the cortex.  Expression levels and polarity of this auxin efflux carrier change during primordium development suggesting that cycles of auxin build-up and depletion accompany, and may direct, different stages of primordium development. PIN1 action on plant development does not strictly require function of PGP1 and PGP19 proteins.	PIN-FORMED 1 (PIN1)	ARG_06_01

AtE2Fc is regulated by a balance between gene expression and ubiquitin-proteasome proteolysis.  AtE2Fc might play a role in cell division and during the transition from skotomorphogenesis to photomorphogenesis. E2Fc has been shown to interact with DPB in its nonphosphorylated form; when E2Fc is phosphorylated, the formation of the E2Fc/DPB heterodimer is lost. E2Fc is required for miR396 activity on cell proliferation under UV-B.  Its role is independent of E2Fe, probably modulating DNA damage responses through the regulation of SOG1 and ATR transcript levels.	(ATE2F2)	ARG_06_01

ATMLO5 belongs to the clade III, with AtMLO7, AtMLO8, AtMLO9, and AtMLO10. The gene is expressed during seedling growth, in cotyledon vascular system, and in stigma, anther and pollen grains; it was not expressed in rosette leaves, as shown by GUS activity patterns.

Mutants carrying null alleles express similar fruit phenotypes, as seen in er plants, but differ from er in that the stem is only slightly shorter than that in the wild type, the pedicel is slightly longer than that in the wild type, and the leaves are rounder than those in er mutants. Gene is expressed in all tissues examined, with highest expression level found in siliques. It is involved in resistance to Plectosphaerella cucumerina. The predicted protein has two DWD motifs. It can bind to DDB1a in Y2H assays and may be involved in the formation of a CUL4-based E3 ubiquitin ligase.  It seems to be involved in the calcium-mediated response to extracellular ATP.

Plants with recessive mutant alleles have complex phenotypes including: reduced brassinolide response, reduced cell divisions, round leaves, short hypocotyls.  It is likely to be involved in the signaling events that trigger unfolded protein response-associated cell death. GPA1 is also involved in sugar signaling. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

Ha412HOChr10g0470991	58	0	1	AT1G19180	JAZ1 is a nuclear-localized protein involved in jasmonate signaling. JAZ1 transcript levels rise in response to a jasmonate stimulus. JAZ1 can interact with the COI1 F-box subunit of an SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase in a yeast-two-hybrid assay only in the presence of jasmonate-isoleucine (JA-ILE) or coronatine. Application of jasmonate methyl ester to Arabidopsis roots reduces the levels of a JAZ1:GUS fusion protein, presumably  by stimulating ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation. The Jas domain appears to be important for JAZ1-COI1 interactions in the presence of coronatine. Two positive residues (R205 and R206) in the Jas domain shown to be important for coronatine -dependent COI1 binding are not required for binding AtMYC2. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

Ha412HOChr10g0471681	308	0	4	AT1G72970	Originally identified as a mutation that causes floral organs to fuse together. About 10-20% of mutants also have defects in ovules. Mutants have reduced fertility most likely as because of fusions that pistil emergence. The protein has similarity to the mandelonitrile lyase family of FAD containing oxidoreductases and is predicted to be secreted (SignalP).It is expressed in all tissue layers of roots, inflorescences, stems, leaves, and flowers and is also expressed in siliques. Expression is highest in inflorescence and flower tissue.Transmission of mutant alleles to the progeny shows non mendelian segregation- a percentage of mutant alleles revert back to a previous parental (e.g. grandparental) wild type allele. It has been suggested that an RNA template driven or other extra-DNA genomic mechanism may be responsible for the non-mendelian inheritance of HTH. Reversion events in alleles at other loci have also been observed to occur in plants with an hth mutant background indicating a genome wide effect.	HOTHEAD (HTH)	ARG_10_01

Also involved in cytokinin-dependent inhibition of hypocotyl elongation and cytokinin-dependent greening and shooting in tissue culture. ARR1, ARR10, and ARR12 are redundant regulators of drought response, with ARR1 being the most critical.The retention of leaf water content, maintenance of cell membrane stability, and enhancement of anthocyanin biosynthesis were found to contribute to the enhanced drought tolerance of the arr1,10,12 triple mutant. ARR1, ARR10 and ARR12 redundantly bind to the promoter of WUSCHEL (WUS), directly activate its transcription. In parallel, ARR1, ARR10 and ARR12 repress the expression of YUCCAs (YUCs), which encode a key enzyme for auxin biosynthesis, indirectly promoting WUS induction. The regulation of ARR1, ARR10 and ARR12 on WUS and YUCs is required for regeneration and maintenance of shoot meristem.	RESPONSE REGULATOR 12 (RR12)	ARG_10_01

The DAYSLEEPER gene lacks 8 bp duplications and TIRs (a common feature of transcriptionally silent hAT transposases), however, DAYSLEEPER expression was detected, and several expressed sequence tags are available. The expression seems to be under the control of factors determining the circadian rhythm. DAYSLEEPER was isolated as a factor binding to a motif (Kubox1) present in the upstream region of the Arabidopsis DNA repair gene Ku70. Mutant plants lacking DAYSLEEPER or strongly overexpressing this gene do not develop in a normal manner.	DAYSLEEPER (DAYSLEEPER)	ARG_10_01

Represses expression of Constans (CO), a circadian regulator of flowering time.  Interacts with LKP2 and FKF1. Expression oscillates under constant light conditions. Mainly expressed in the vasculature of cotyledons, leaves and hypocotyls, but also in stomata. Localized to the nucleus and acts as a repressor of CONSTANS through binding to the Dof binding sites in the CO promoter. Protein gets degraded by FKF1 in the afternoon. CDF1 binds to the TOPLESS co-repressor protein through an N-terminal motif which is conserved across CDF-like proteins throughout land-plants. This interaction is important for the repression of CO and FT genes during the morning. Loss of CDF1 dependent repression through omission of TPL coordinating residues or through the loss of TPL function in phloem companion cells results in early flowering due to an up regulation of FT.

Ha412HOChr05g0236221	132	0	3	AT4G18770	MYB98 is a member of the R2R3-MYB gene family, the members of which likely encode transcription factors. Within an ovule, MYB98 is expressed exclusively in the synergid cells, and mutations in this gene affect the female gametophyte specifically. myb98 female gametophytes are affected in two unique features of the synergid cell, pollen tube guidance and the filiform apparatus, but are otherwise normal. This suggests that MYB98 controls the development of specific features within the synergid cell during female gametophyte development. MYB98 also is expressed in trichomes and endosperm. Homozygous myb98 mutants exhibit no sporophytic defects, including trichome and endosperm defects.	MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN 98 (MYB98)	PETFAL_05_01

Based on protein sequence alignment analysis, it has a typical RD signaling domain in its catalytic loop and possesses autophosphorylation activity.It is required for the suppression of defense responses in absence of pathogen infection or upon abscisic acid treatment. Loss-of-function mutants display enhanced resistance to Botrytis cinerea and Pectobacterium carotovorum. Its expression is repressed by pathogen infection and biological elicitors and is induced abscisic acid.Expression is strongly repressed by elicitors and fungal infection, and is induced by the hormone abscisic acid (ABA). Insertional mutants show increased expression of PHYTOALEXIN-DEFICIENT 3 (PAD3), enhanced resistance to Botrytis cinerea and Pectobacterium carotovorum infection and reduced physiological responses to ABA, suggesting that LYK3 is important for the cross-talk between signaling pathways activated by ABA and pathogens (PMID:24639336).

TBL gene family has 46 members, two of which (TBR/AT5G06700 and TBL3/AT5G01360) have been shown to be involved in the synthesis and deposition of secondary wall cellulose, presumably by influencing the esterification state of pectic polymers. A nomenclature for this gene family has been proposed (Volker Bischoff & Wolf Scheible, 2010, personal communication).	TRICHOME BIREFRINGENCE-LIKE 11 (TBL11)	PETFAL_05_01
Ha412HOChr05g0239361	0	0	0	AT1G15750	Encodes a protein with several WD40 repeats at the C-terminus and predicted protein-protein interaction domains at the N-terminus.  Together with the TOPLESS-RELATED PROTEINS (TPRs), it is thought to be involved in transcriptional repression of root-promoting genes in the top half of the embryo during the transition stage of embryogenesis. It can also interact with IAA12 through the EAR domain of IAA12 and the CTLH domain of TPL. The ability of IAA12 to repress transcription is diminished in a tpl-1 mutant background.

It is involved in the response to cold, drought (negative regulator of drought tolerance), and ABA. Mutants in this gene exhibit enhanced induction of stress genes in response to cold, ABA, salt and dehydration and increased levels of  3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate (PAP). Involved in degradation of small mRNAs. Mutants also affect the accumulation of miRNA target cleavage products. Regulates light-dependent repression of hypocotyl elongation and flowering time via its 3'(2'),5'-bisphosphate nucleotidase activity. Its activity is sensitive to the redox state of its environment, decreasing under oxidative conditions and is regulated by dimerization and intra and inter-molecular disulfide bond formation.

Upon DSB formation, rapid accumulation of phosphorylated  H2AX (&#947;-H2AX) occurs around the break site. H2AX foci accumulate in early G2.  Immunolocalization studies in spread preparations of  wild-type meiocytes at G2/early leptotene revealed  the accumulation of numerous rather diffuse &#947;-H2AX  foci throughout the chromatin. However,  their accumulation is not contemporaneous with  that of AtSPO11-1. At 3 h post-S, no &#947;-H2AX  foci are detected. During the 3- to 5-h window when  AtSPO11-1 foci rapidly disappear, there is an  equally swift accumulation of &#947;-H2AX to a maximum  of >50 diffuse foci. The level of &#947;H2AX then remains  constant for a further 13 h before undergoing a  gradual decrease to 10?20 foci in the 18- to 24-h post-S  period.

Ha412HOChr11g0482101	141	0	2	AT5G65640	bHLH093/NFL encodes a bHLH transcription factor involved in GA mediated control of flowering time. Mutants are non-flowering in short days and phenotype can be reversed with GA application. Based on the expression of GA biosynthetic genes in the mutant, it likely acts through regulation of GA metabolism. Its expression shows developmental stage and tissue specificity. In short days it is expressed mainly in root tips and SAM, with weak expression in cotyledons throughout development. In LD GUS activity was observed in the hypocotyl and in root tips and SAM throughout the developmental stages.	BETA HLH PROTEIN 93 (bHLH093)	PETFAL_11_01

UEV1A can form diubiquitin and triubiquitin chains in combination with UBC13A/UBC35 in vitro. It can also functionally complement an mms2 mutation in budding yeast, both by increasing mms2 mutant viability in the presence of the DNA damaging agent MMS, and by reducing the rate of spontaneous DNA mutation. However, a combination of MMZ1/UEV1A and UBC13A do not do a good job of rescuing an mms2 ubc13 double mutant in yeast. MMZ1/UEV1A transcripts are found at low levels in most plant organs, but cannot be detected in the pollen. Transcript levels do not appear to be stress-inducible. The uev1a-1 mutant shows normal sensitivity to MMS in germination assays suggesting that UEV1A is not required for DNA damage tolerance during this developmental stage.

The DAYSLEEPER gene lacks 8 bp duplications and TIRs (a common feature of transcriptionally silent hAT transposases), however, DAYSLEEPER expression was detected, and several expressed sequence tags are available. The expression seems to be under the control of factors determining the circadian rhythm. DAYSLEEPER was isolated as a factor binding to a motif (Kubox1) present in the upstream region of the Arabidopsis DNA repair gene Ku70. Mutant plants lacking DAYSLEEPER or strongly overexpressing this gene do not develop in a normal manner.	DAYSLEEPER (DAYSLEEPER)	PETFAL_11_01

Ha412HOChr11g0499081	29	0	1	AT5G58230	Encodes a WD-40 repeat containing protein that functions in chromatin assembly as part of the CAF1 and FIE complex. Mutants exhibit parthenogenetic development that includes proliferation of unfertilized endosperm and embryos. In heterozygous plants 50% of embryos abort. Of the aborted embryos the early aborted class are homozygous and the later aborting lass are heterozygotes in which the defective allele is maternally transmitted. Other phenotypes include defects in ovule morphogenesis and organ initiation,as well as increased levels of heterochromatic DNA. MSI1 is needed for the transition to flowering. In Arabidopsis, the three CAF-1 subunits are encoded by FAS1, FAS2 and, most likely, MSI1, respectively. Mutations in FAS1 or FAS2 lead to increased frequency of homologous recombination and T-DNA integration in Arabidopsis. In the ovule, the MSI1 transcripts are accumulated at their highest level before fertilization and gradually decrease after fertilization. MSI is biallelically expressed, the paternall allele is expressed in the endosperm and embryo and is not imprinted. MSI1 forms a complex with RBR1 that is required for activation of the imprinted genes FIS2 and FWA. This activation is mediated by MSI1/RBR1 mediated repression of MET1.

RPF1 is required for the 5?-end processing of the nad4 mRNA in mitochondria. Ler and other accessions impaired in processing of the nad4 mRNA 5&#8242;-end, contain a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 807 nucleotides downstream of the predicted translation start codon (G807A).

Knockouts of CAP1 produced more cytoplasmic NH4+ and ceased growth of root hairs on MS medium except when NH4+ was depleted; NH4+ depletion reestablished the Ca2+ gradient necessary for normal growth. The lower net NH4+ influx across the vacuolar membrane and relatively alkaline cytosolic pH of root hairs in cap1-1 relative to wild type implied that mutation of CAP1 results in more NH4+ accumulation in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, CAP1 functionally complemented npr1 kinase yeast mutant defective in high-affinity NH4+ uptake via MEP2, distinguishing CAP1 as a cytosolic modulator of NH4+ level that participates in NH4+ homeostasis-regulated root hair growth by modulating tip-focused cytoplasmic Ca2+ gradients.

PIN5 does not have a direct role in cell-to-cell transport but regulates intracellular auxin homeostasis and metabolism. PIN5 localizes, unlike other characterized plasma membrane PIN proteins, to endoplasmic reticulum (ER), presumably mediating auxin flow from the cytosol to the lumen of the ER.

SYR1/PEN1 is a member of the SNARE superfamily and functions in positioning anchoring of the KAT1 K+ channel protein at the plasma membrane. Transcription is upregulated by abscisic acid, suggesting a role in ABA signaling.  Also functions in non-host resistance against barley powdery mildew. It is a nonessential component of the preinvasive resistance against Colletotrichum fungus. Required for mlo resistance. The syp121 point mutation results in stomatal phenotypes that reduce CO2 assimilation, slow vegetative growth and increase water use efficiency in the whole plant, conditional upon high light intensities and low relative humidity. The R20R21 motif of SYP121 are essential for SEC11 interaction.

Putative transcriptional regulator repressing the gibberellin response and integration of phytohormone signalling. DELLAs repress cell proliferation and expansion that drives plant growth. The protein undergoes degradation in response to GA via the 26S proteasome. RGA1 binds to PIF3 and  inhibits its DNA binding activity and thus affects the expression of PIF3 regulated genes. RGA may be involved in reducing ROS accumulation in response to stress by up-regulating the transcription of superoxide dismutases. Represses GA-induced vegetative growth and floral initiation.

Ha412HOChr14g0669191	154	0	4	AT4G39400	Encodes a plasma membrane localized leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase involved in brassinosteroid signal transduction. BRI1 ligand is brassinolide which binds at the extracellular domain. Binding results in phosphorylation of the kinase domain which activates the BRI1 protein leading to BR responses. Residue T-1049 and either S-1044 or T-1045 were essential for kinase function in vitro and normal BRI1 signaling in planta. The structure of BRI1 ligand-binding domain has been determined at 2.5A resolution.  Although BAK1 and BRI1 alone localize in the plasma membrane, when BAK1 and BRI1 are coexpressed, the heterodimer BAK1/BRI1 they form is localized in the endosome. BRI1 appears to be involved in the autonomous pathway that regulates the transition to flowering, primarily through its effects on FLC expression levels, as uncovered by double mutant analyses. This most likely occurs as a result of BRI1-dependent effects on histone acetylation, but not histone triMeH3K4 methylation, at the FLC locus. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

Ha412HOChr14g0671101	273	0	5	AT5G65700	Encodes a CLAVATA1-related receptor kinase-like protein required for both shoot and flower meristem function. Very similar to BAM2,with more than 85% a.a. identity. It has a broad expression pattern and is involved in vascular strand development in the leaf, control of leaf shape, size and symmetry, male gametophyte development and ovule specification and function. Anthers of double mutants (bam1bam2) appeared abnormal at a very early stage and lack the endothecium, middle, and tapetum layers. Further analyses revealed that cells interior to the epidermis (in anther tissue) acquire some characteristics of pollen mother cells (PMCs), suggesting defects in cell fate specification. The pollen mother-like cells degenerate before the completion of meiosis, suggesting that these cells are defective. In addition, the BAM1 expression pattern supports both an early role in promoting somatic cell fates and a subsequent function in the PMCs. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

The cytoplasmic Ran GTPase activating protein RanGAP is critical to establish a functional RanGTP/RanGDP gradient across the nuclear envelope and is associated with the outer surface of the nuclear envelope in metazoan and higher plant cells. Arabidopsis thaliana RanGAP association with the root tip nuclear envelope requires a family of likely plant-specific nucleoporins combining coiled-coil and transmembrane domains (CC-TMD) and WPP domain-interacting proteins (WIPs).  WIT1 and WIT2 have been identified as a second family of CC-TMD proteins, structurally similar, yet clearly distinct from the WIP family, that is required for RanGAP nuclear envelop association in root tip cells.

The HDS enzyme controls the penultimate steps of the biosynthesis of IPP and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) via the MEP pathway and may serve as a metabolic control point for SA-mediated disease resistance. In the light, the electrons required for the reaction catalyzed by HDS are directly provided by the electron flow from photosynthesis via ferredoxin. In the dark however, the enzyme requires an electron shuttle: ferredoxin-NADP<sup>+</sup> reductase.

Ha412HOChr14g0678181	0	0	0	AT5G03150	JKD is a nuclear-localized putative transcription factor of the BIRDS/IDD C2H2 zinc finger family. JKD and its homologue BIB, restrict SHR movement to a single layer, the endodermis, and delimit tissue boundaries in the root meristem through a process that involves nuclear retention through protein complex formation. JKD mutation leads to periclinal divisions in the cortex, increased cell numbers in the circumference of the cortical and epidermal layers, a disrupted QC marker expression pattern, and disorganized QC and columella cells. This effect is enhanced in jkd bib double mutants where tissue boundaries cannot be maintained due to excessive SHR movement. JKD and BIB restrict CYCIND6 expression to cortex and endodermis stem cells to prevent formative divisions in the ground tissue.  JKD physically interacts with cell fate determinants SCR and SHR in a cell type specific manner. Native FRET-FLIM analysis showed higher JKD-SCR complex in the endodermis and predominant JKD-SHR in the QC and cortex/endodermis stem cells. In addition, JKD, SCR and SHR form a ternary complex whose conformation is cell type dependent, conformational changes of this complex differentially regulate SCR and WOX5 expression to specify endodermal cell fate and QC function respectively. Its mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.	JACKDAW (JKD)	PETFAL_14_01

The Arabidopsis genome contains 15 genes encoding MLO proteins, with localization in plasma membrane. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four clades of closely-related AtMLO genes. ATMLO6 belongs to the clade IV, with AtMLO2, AtMLO3 and AtMLO12. The gene is expressed during early seedling growth, in root tips and cotyledon vascular system, in floral organs (anthers and stigma), and in fruit abscission zone, as shown by GUS activity patterns. The expression of several phylogenetically closely-related AtMLO genes showed similar or overlapping tissue specificity and analogous responsiveness to external stimuli, suggesting functional redundancy, co-function, or antagonistic function(s).

Ha412HOChr14g0679791	253	0	7	AT5G03150	JKD is a nuclear-localized putative transcription factor of the BIRDS/IDD C2H2 zinc finger family. JKD and its homologue BIB, restrict SHR movement to a single layer, the endodermis, and delimit tissue boundaries in the root meristem through a process that involves nuclear retention through protein complex formation. JKD mutation leads to periclinal divisions in the cortex, increased cell numbers in the circumference of the cortical and epidermal layers, a disrupted QC marker expression pattern, and disorganized QC and columella cells. This effect is enhanced in jkd bib double mutants where tissue boundaries cannot be maintained due to excessive SHR movement. JKD and BIB restrict CYCIND6 expression to cortex and endodermis stem cells to prevent formative divisions in the ground tissue.  JKD physically interacts with cell fate determinants SCR and SHR in a cell type specific manner. Native FRET-FLIM analysis showed higher JKD-SCR complex in the endodermis and predominant JKD-SHR in the QC and cortex/endodermis stem cells. In addition, JKD, SCR and SHR form a ternary complex whose conformation is cell type dependent, conformational changes of this complex differentially regulate SCR and WOX5 expression to specify endodermal cell fate and QC function respectively. Its mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.	JACKDAW (JKD)	PETFAL_14_01

Represses expression of Constans (CO), a circadian regulator of flowering time.  Interacts with LKP2 and FKF1. Expression oscillates under constant light conditions. Mainly expressed in the vasculature of cotyledons, leaves and hypocotyls, but also in stomata. Localized to the nucleus and acts as a repressor of CONSTANS through binding to the Dof binding sites in the CO promoter. Protein gets degraded by FKF1 in the afternoon. CDF1 binds to the TOPLESS co-repressor protein through an N-terminal motif which is conserved across CDF-like proteins throughout land-plants. This interaction is important for the repression of CO and FT genes during the morning. Loss of CDF1 dependent repression through omission of TPL coordinating residues or through the loss of TPL function in phloem companion cells results in early flowering due to an up regulation of FT.

Ha412HOChr05g0236341	173	0	4	AT1G51940	Encodes a LysM-containing receptor-like kinase.  Induction of chitin-responsive genes by chitin treatment is not blocked in the mutant. Based on protein sequence alignment analysis, it has a typical RD signaling domain in its catalytic loop and possesses autophosphorylation activity.It is required for the suppression of defense responses in absence of pathogen infection or upon abscisic acid treatment. Loss-of-function mutants display enhanced resistance to Botrytis cinerea and Pectobacterium carotovorum. Its expression is repressed by pathogen infection and biological elicitors and is induced abscisic acid.Expression is strongly repressed by elicitors and fungal infection, and is induced by the hormone abscisic acid (ABA). Insertional mutants show increased expression of PHYTOALEXIN-DEFICIENT 3 (PAD3), enhanced resistance to Botrytis cinerea and Pectobacterium carotovorum infection and reduced physiological responses to ABA, suggesting that LYK3 is important for the cross-talk between signaling pathways activated by ABA and pathogens (PMID:24639336).

However, in the Ws ecotype, a functional terpene synthase that localizes to the chloroplast is encoded at this locus. It can catalyze the synthesis of (E)-beta-ocimene and (E,E)-alpha farnesene in vitro, but, it has more activity as an (E)-beta-ocimene synthase activity in vivo. This may reflect the greater availability of the GPP precursor of (E)-beta-ocimene than of the FPP precursor of (E,E)-alpha-farnesene in the chloroplasts where the Ws TPS02 is present.

Protein has two plant-specific (AP2/EREB) DNA-binding domains and is involved in the control of storage compound biosynthesis in Arabidopsis. Mutants have wrinkled seed phenotype, due to a defect in the incorporation of sucrose and glucose into triacylglycerols. Transgenic sGsL plants (21-day-old) grown on 6% sucrose for 24 hours had 2-fold increase in levels of expressions (sGsL line carries a single copy of T-DNA containing the Spomin::GUS-Spomin::LUC dual reporter genes in the upper arm of chromosome 5 of ecotype Col-0. The sporamin .minimal. promoter directs sugar-inducible expression of the LUC and GUS reporters in leaves). Regulation by LEC2 promotes fatty acid accumulation during seed maturation. Splice form 3 is the major form expressed in seedlings.Mutations in the C terminal intrinsically disordered region increase the stability of WRI1 and lead to increased oil production.

It is involved in the response to cold, drought (negative regulator of drought tolerance), and ABA. Mutants in this gene exhibit enhanced induction of stress genes in response to cold, ABA, salt and dehydration and increased levels of  3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate (PAP). Involved in degradation of small mRNAs. Mutants also affect the accumulation of miRNA target cleavage products. Regulates light-dependent repression of hypocotyl elongation and flowering time via its 3'(2'),5'-bisphosphate nucleotidase activity. Its activity is sensitive to the redox state of its environment, decreasing under oxidative conditions and is regulated by dimerization and intra and inter-molecular disulfide bond formation.

Upon DSB formation, rapid accumulation of phosphorylated  H2AX (&#947;-H2AX) occurs around the break site. H2AX foci accumulate in early G2.  Immunolocalization studies in spread preparations of  wild-type meiocytes at G2/early leptotene revealed  the accumulation of numerous rather diffuse &#947;-H2AX  foci throughout the chromatin. However,  their accumulation is not contemporaneous with  that of AtSPO11-1. At 3 h post-S, no &#947;-H2AX  foci are detected. During the 3- to 5-h window when  AtSPO11-1 foci rapidly disappear, there is an  equally swift accumulation of &#947;-H2AX to a maximum  of >50 diffuse foci. The level of &#947;H2AX then remains  constant for a further 13 h before undergoing a  gradual decrease to 10?20 foci in the 18- to 24-h post-S  period. By 30 h the foci have disappeared from the chromatin.	GAMMA HISTONE VARIANT H2AX (GAMMA-H2AX)	PETPET_09_01

It can catalyze the synthesis of (E)-beta-ocimene and (E,E)-alpha farnesene in vitro, but, it has more activity as an (E)-beta-ocimene synthase activity in vivo. This may reflect the greater availability of the GPP precursor of (E)-beta-ocimene than of the FPP precursor of (E,E)-alpha-farnesene in the chloroplasts where the Ws TPS02 is present.

UEV1A can form diubiquitin and triubiquitin chains in combination with UBC13A/UBC35 in vitro. It can also functionally complement an mms2 mutation in budding yeast, both by increasing mms2 mutant viability in the presence of the DNA damaging agent MMS, and by reducing the rate of spontaneous DNA mutation. However, a combination of MMZ1/UEV1A and UBC13A do not do a good job of rescuing an mms2 ubc13 double mutant in yeast. MMZ1/UEV1A transcripts are found at low levels in most plant organs, but cannot be detected in the pollen. Transcript levels do not appear to be stress-inducible. The uev1a-1 mutant shows normal sensitivity to MMS in germination assays suggesting that UEV1A is not required for DNA damage tolerance during this developmental stage.

The DAYSLEEPER gene lacks 8 bp duplications and TIRs (a common feature of transcriptionally silent hAT transposases), however, DAYSLEEPER expression was detected, and several expressed sequence tags are available. The expression seems to be under the control of factors determining the circadian rhythm. DAYSLEEPER was isolated as a factor binding to a motif (Kubox1) present in the upstream region of the Arabidopsis DNA repair gene Ku70. Mutant plants lacking DAYSLEEPER or strongly overexpressing this gene do not develop in a normal manner.	DAYSLEEPER (DAYSLEEPER)	PETPET_11_01

UBC35/UBC13A can form diubiquitin and triubiquitin chains in combination with MMZ1,2,3,4/(UEV1A,B,C,D) in vitro. It can also functionally complement an mms2 ubc13 mutation in budding yeast by increasing the double mutant's viability in the presence of the DNA damaging agent MMS, when it is co-expressed with MMZ / UEV1 genes. A wild type phenotype is restored with MMZ3/UEV1C and MMZ4/UEV1D, but only partial complementation is achieved with MMZ1/UEV1A or MMZ2/UEV1B. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

Ha412HOChr11g0490541	0	0	0	AT5G11980	COG8 is a component of a putative  conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex that is thought to be involved in tethering of retrograde intra Golgi vesicles. It is required for proper deposition of cell wall materials in pollen tube growth. In mutant pollen,golgi appear abnormal.When homozygotes can be produced (by complementing the defect in pollen), the plants are embryo lethal suggesting an essential function. COG8 interacts with several other putative COG components.	CONSERVED OLIGOMERIC GOLGI COMPLEX 8 (COG8)	PETPET_11_01

Ha412HOChr11g0499081	29	0	1	AT5G58230	Encodes a WD-40 repeat containing protein that functions in chromatin assembly as part of the CAF1 and FIE complex. Mutants exhibit parthenogenetic development that includes proliferation of unfertilized endosperm and embryos. In heterozygous plants 50% of embryos abort. Of the aborted embryos the early aborted class are homozygous and the later aborting lass are heterozygotes in which the defective allele is maternally transmitted. Other phenotypes include defects in ovule morphogenesis and organ initiation,as well as increased levels of heterochromatic DNA. MSI1 is needed for the transition to flowering. In Arabidopsis, the three CAF-1 subunits are encoded by FAS1, FAS2 and, most likely, MSI1, respectively. Mutations in FAS1 or FAS2 lead to increased frequency of homologous recombination and T-DNA integration in Arabidopsis. In the ovule, the MSI1 transcripts are accumulated at their highest level before fertilization and gradually decrease after fertilization. MSI is biallelically expressed, the paternall allele is expressed in the endosperm and embryo and is not imprinted.
